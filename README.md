## Installation
Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/NuttidaLab/rnn_oddball.git
cd rnn_oddball
```

Create a conda environment using the tf.yml file included in this repository.
```
conda env create -f tf2.yml
conda activate tf2
```
This environment uses Python 3.6 and TensorFlow 2.6.2. For additional details on training requirements, please refer to the spikeRNN repository: https://github.com/rkim35/spikeRNN

Installation typically takes ~3–4 minutes on a standard workstation (e.g., 4–8 CPU cores, ≥16 GB RAM) but may vary depending on internet speed and package download times.
